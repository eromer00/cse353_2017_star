Files:

Main.java 	- The main class, which instantiates the switch and all nodes, as well as performing cleanup.
Frame.java 	- Implements a custom frame format
Node2017.java 	- Implements a generic node, which can be generated and connected to a switch.
Switch.java 	- Implements a switch which can connect up to 255 nodes to allow for their communication, and buffers frames if needed. 
Makefile	- Build automation
README 		- Documentation for this project, including compilation instructions
