Compilation Instructions:

Compilation can be done via the Makefile provided along with this assignment. Calling "make all" in the terminal when in a directory with the Makefile and source code present will perform the compilation.

Execution Instructions:

Simply called "java Main [number of switches] [number of nodes]" in the directory with the compiled .class files for this project.

Files:

CASListenerThread.java	- A listener thread so the CAS can be open to incoming node connections
CASSwitch.java 		- Secondard switch, which directly connects to the nodes, and talks to the CCS Switch
CCSListenerThread.java	- A listener thread for CCS switches, which allows them to listenening to incoming CAS switch connections
CCSSwitch.java		- Main switch, which acts as a mediator for communication between CAS Switches
Frame.java		- Frame class, which defines the frames that are send through the network
Main.java		- Main class, which instantiates the switches and nodes
Node.java		- Nodes that represent individual machines in the network
NodeListener.java	- A listener thread for nodes, so they can listen to incoming connections
README			- This file, with compilation and run instructions as well as the feature checklist
Makefile		- Project build automation
