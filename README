Compilation Instructions:

Compilation can be done via the Makefile provided along with this assignment. Calling "make all" in the terminal when in a directory with the Makefile and source code present will perform the compilation.

Execution Instructions:

To execute, simply call "java Main" in the directory with the compiled .class files. 

Files:

Main.java - The main method of the project. Instantiates switches and nodes, as well as runs them. Also exists them all cleanly.
Frame.java - Implements a custom frame format
Node2017.java - Implements a generic node, which can be generated and connected to a switch.
Switch.java - Implements a switch which can connect up to 255 nodes to allow for their communication, and buffers frames if needed. 
README - Documentation for this project, including compilation instructions
Makefile - Build automation for this project

Feature Checklist:

Project Compiles and Builds 	|	
without warnings or errors	|
				|
Switch class			|
				|
Switch has a frame 		|
buffer, and read/writes 	|
appropriately			|
				|
Switch allows multiple 		|
connections			|
				|
Switch floods frame when it 	|			
doesn't know the destination	|
				|
Switch learns destinations, 	|
and doesn't forward 		|
packet to any port 		|
except the one required		|			
				|
Node class			|						
				|
Nodes instantiate, 		|
and open connection 		|
to the switch			|
				|
Nodes open their 		|
input files, and 		|
send data to switch		|
				|
Nodes open their output 	|
files, and save data 		|
that they recieved		|
